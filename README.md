# üíº Laravel Job Board Platform

##  Overview
The **Laravel Job Board** project is a web-based application that connects **employers** and **candidates** in an easy-to-use platform. Employers can post and manage job listings, while candidates can search, apply, and track job opportunities. Administrators oversee the platform by approving job posts and monitoring activities.
